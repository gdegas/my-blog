So it's been about a few months now that I've been living in Oakland and I thought I started to get the hang of it and feel pretty relaxed until recently something happened to me that affected my whole mindset about living and chilling around here.

###Let's rewind a little bit

I moved up here exactly 5 months ago tomorrow. When I first moved up here I heard about some of the problems with crime that can come up while living around here. Not too long ago I remember my uncle (who's sorta close minded/older) complained that Oakland was the murder capital of the United States. I didn't think much of it back then.

Since my brother has been living up here for a little while and I've come up and visited him on a couple of occasions, I thought that Oakland wasn't all that bad. I mean each time I came and visisted I met nice people and obviously the diversity was there, but not in a threatening way.

###My struggles started with the commute

When I first moved up here, I was consistently frustrated with dealing with my morning commute. I live in the Laurel Heights district of Oakland and it's not exactly clear path to get to my job at Uber in San Francisco.

I have a couple options:

1. I can bike to the BART stop (Fruitvale) and then BART into SF stopping at Montgommery

```txt
 Bike to bart ~20min
 BART to SF ~30 min
 Walk to desk ~5 min
```

**_Advantage_**: I get a nice workout on the bike ride in the morning.
**_Disadvantage_**: I almost get run over by cars every morning...and it can be cold.

2. I can take the local bus to the BART, the BART into SF.

```txt
 Walk to bus ~10min
 Bus to BART ~15-20 min
 BART to SF ~30 min
 Walk to desk ~5 min
```

**_Advantage_**: hard to say...this one is usually long and ridden with public transit folks.

**_Disadvantage_**: Taking public transit in Oakland you always find interesting people(and not interesting in the way that you want to hang out with them). Also this option I think is more expensive.

3. I can take a bus that comes in front of my neighborhood that drops me off a short walk away from work

```Txt
 Walk to bus ~10min
 Bus to BART ~15-20 min
 BART to SF ~30 min
 Walk to desk ~5 min
```
